# colorDualPions

This data is associated with the arxiv paper, "Double-copy towards supergravity inflation with $\alpha$-attractor models" (Carrasco, Lewandoski, and Pavao).

To access the data, download the file colorDualData.zip from this repository. Untar and unzip the file. This will create a directory colorDualData.  Download additional files of interest like the larger five-point files and include in that directory. 

Inside the directory colorDualData will be a Mathematica notebook: resultsGuide.nb. This notebook will explain how to use and understand the included data.
